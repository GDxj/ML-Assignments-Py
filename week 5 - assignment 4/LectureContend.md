# Neural Network Training
- we must account for multiple theta matrices. The number of columns in our current theta matrix is equal to the number of nodes in our current layer (including the bias unit)
- backpropogation
  1. calculate activations using forwardpropogation
  2. calculate error backwards 
  3. calculate partial derivatives of Cost
