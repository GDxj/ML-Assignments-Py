## Neural Network
  - Non linear classifier （motivation) (log reg is linear classifier)
    when n large and there is no linear relation, it is hard to use quadratic/cubic terms as its going to create too many terms -> overfitting
  - weight = theta, activation function = hypothethis (at each neuron，not just out put layer）
  - input layer, hiden layer, output layer, bias unit
  - use hidden layer to compute input of hypo instead of using x as input directly as logistic reg
  - Multi Class: similar to dummy variable
  - do not regularize theta0 which is parameter of bias term
