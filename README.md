# ML-Assignments-Py
## Backgroud
  This project will be conducted in python Jupyter instead of Matlab (which is the defaut choice in this course). Material used for assignments:
  1. [The Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng 
  2. [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)
  3. [Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)
  
## Goals
  1. Apply algorithms from scratch according to lecture
  2. Build/Select models using Python packages
  3. Compare the result
