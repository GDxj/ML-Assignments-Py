# ML-Assignments-Py
## Backgroud
  This project will be conducted in python Jupyter instead of Matlab (which is the defaut choice in this course). Material used for assignments:
  1. [The Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) by Andrew Ng 
  2. [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)
  3. [Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/)
  
## Goals
  1. Apply algorithms from scratch (mathematically) according to lectures 
  2. Build/Select models using Python packages
  3. Compare the results

## Notes
  * 20201006: Starting from exercise3, Python version of matlab/octive pre-defined functions are quoted from here: https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments <br>
  As it is way too time consuming to write pre-defined functions (which does not help understand the course) from scratch. Mathematical part still built from scratch though.
  * 20201208: one more great repository to learn from: https://github.com/andrewenoble/machine-learning-andrew-ng
