- When large error in predictions
  1. get more training data
  2. try smaller set of data
  3. try getting additional features
  4. try adding polynomial features
  5. try decreasing lambda
  6. try increasing lambda
- ml diagnositic
  1. what is/isnt working
  2. gain insight of how to improve the model
- training/testing procesure
  1. learn theta using training data
  2. calculate error using test set (test set error or test set cost)
- model selection
  * train/validation/test  60/20/20
  * use validation set to select model
